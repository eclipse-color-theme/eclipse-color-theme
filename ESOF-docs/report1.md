##Brief description of the project

Eclipse Color Theme makes it possible to import and switch color themes conveniently and without side effects.
While Eclipse allows you to change the syntax coloring in great detail, there is no support for managing multiple color themes. 
It is possible to achieve that by importing and exporting preferences files, but this is inconvenient and likely to mess up your preferences. Furthermore, color themes have to be created for every single editor, a theme for the Java editor does not change the XML, JavaScript or any other editors. This plugin solves these issues by mapping a generic color theme format to specific preferences entries for each supported editor.

##Development Process

We couldn't contact the developers, but by analysing the commits made thorough the growth of the application, we were able to approximate the development process used by those who initially started this endeavour.
Our group came to the conclusion that the aforementioned process adopted was Iterative and Incremental Development which can be succinctly described as small changes to the code, which are then tested, and if workable, commited to the main project. 
After analysing this process, among all that were studied, we found it to be the one that best fit the commits in Eclipse Color Theme.

As this is an community driven project, this aproach has the advantage of facilitating the involvement of new developers, even with small contributions, at any state of the development.


###Contributing

There are multiple ways to contribute to the development of the plugin, namely, creating an editor mapping, creating a theme and you can contribute to code too.

* Creating an editor mapping:
	Create a new mapping for any new editor, this does not require programming and is fairly easy to contribute, you just need to do some research.

* Creating a theme:
	Create a custom theme for any editor supported by the plugin.
	
* Contributing to the code:
	Contribute to the code in a positive way, you can correct bugs or add new features.

You don't need a lot of experience to contribute, creating an editor mapping or creating a theme is accessible to anyone who wants to contribute. There is an [**contributor guide**](https://github.com/eclipse-color-theme/eclipse-color-theme/wiki/Contributing) that explains how to get started on working in this project.

To help with the code you first need to open an issue before starting to work.


###Critics and Alternatives

Although the Interactive and Incremental Development Process have the advantages written above it requires higher level of technical excellence, more discipline and buyout from the whole team of contributors. It often requires that the contributors are capable of performing more than one type of tasks (for example develop and test or work on both front-end and back-end).
In that aspect the Prototyping Process is better because it is an initial version of a system used to demonstrate concepts and try out design options. 
The benefits that this process bring to this project are:
* The closer match to user's real needs;
* Improved the design quality;
* Improved maintainability;
* Reduce development effort.

This advantages allows to reduse the inherent project risk by breaking a project into smaller segments and providing more ease-of-change during the development process and allows to explore options and develop a UI design, in design processes. The main disadvantage of Prototyping is that are normally undocumented, which hinders access to information to new contributors.

##Conclusion

We feel that Eclipse Color Theme is an appropriately developed project, and that it will provide us with a good study case for our involvement in this class in the upcoming months. Although we weren't able to contact the developers, the development process they used shines through, and we're sure all the other methods used will as well.

##Contribuition of the team members

We felt that in this first report, the distribution of work was pretty even, leaving everyone with about 25% of the work done.
